## Path Sharp
#### What is this?
Path Sharp is a library written to help with consuming the UiPath web api.

#### How do I use it?
Create a PathClient and call AuthorizeAsync() on it. I think the rest is pretty self explanatory.

#### What's the point?
To help people who want to use the UiPath web api from code but don't want to deal with the hassle of writing the code to do so. I am in no way affiliated with UiPath, I am just doing this to help people and UiPath create a better world. I hope this library will help people who want to use UiPath's services and that it will help UiPath by making their services more accessible.
